# 💼 Salary Predictor using ANN (2025 Dataset)

This project is a hands-on implementation of an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** model to predict salaries using a 2025 dataset.  
The **primary goal** was not to achieve maximum accuracy, but to **explore how ANN performs** on structured/tabular data and to practice deep learning techniques that I’ve been learning.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Understand and implement **ANN architecture** from scratch using Keras/TensorFlow
- Explore how deep learning models handle structured data like salary datasets
- Use **feature engineering** and **EDA** to prepare high-quality input for the model
- Apply techniques like **Batch Normalization** to support training
- Compare ANN with basic models like **Linear Regression**

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- ✅ **Heavy Feature Engineering** for model improvement
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to visualize and understand the dataset
- 🧠 **Custom ANN Model** built with:
  - Input, hidden, and output layers
  - Activation functions (ReLU, etc.)
  - Batch Normalization
- 📈 Performance monitoring using training/validation accuracy and loss

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras

---

## 📂 Dataset

A cleaned and structured **2025 salary dataset** that includes features such as:
- Education level
- Years of experience
- Job title
- Industry
- Region, etc.

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner or GridSearchCV
- Try dropout or early stopping for regularization
- Compare against XGBoost or Random Forest
